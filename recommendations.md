## Software
- Text editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Terminal: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)
- Terminal multiplexer: [tmux](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) (this is great when `ssh`-ing into remote servers)
- Package manager: [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

## Workflow
- Sharing Jupyter Notebooks: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org)
- How to write Git commits: do [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- How to format Python code: [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (so much better than `autopep8`)
- Write internal documents in Markdown: [tutorial](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables)
