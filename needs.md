## Need 1
_Scrub technicians need a better way to manage cables during procedures in order to improve maneuverability around the room._

Procedure rooms require efficient systems of electrical wiring: a call system connecting to the control room, overhead lighting to ensure visibility, electronic vital sign monitors, among other things. As a result, a high density of wires litters the floor of the operating room, leaving nurses, scrub technicians, and surgeons at risk of tripping, potentially leading to accidents which harm both the patients along with the clinicians. However, given the importance of electrical devices in facilitating an effective practicing environment, hospital administrators are hard pressed to find a solution to effectively manage cables in the procedure room while also maintaining functionality.

## Need 2
_Radiology technologists need a way to minimize the time spent monitoring patient vital signs during procedures in order to reduce their heavy workload._

Radiology technologists have one of the largest workloads during procedures: they are responsible for documenting the procedure, recording image and tabular data, and continuously monitoring patient vital signs, all while working across three monitors and in two different software applications. If fatigued, technicians may miss important patient information. There is a clear need to reduce this immense workload in order to prevent work fatigue and improve overall productivity.

## Need 3
_Medical providers need a clearer way to communicate between the procedure and control rooms to reduce instances of miscommunication in time-sensitive situations._

Interventional cardiology procedures require a control room that overlooks the procedure room. A technician typically sits in the control room while the procedure occurs, listening to directions from physicians, nurses, and other support staff. The technician relays information into the procedure room through a microphone that has poor audio quality. Furthermore, it is difficult for scrub technicians to hear speech from medical providers in the procedure room, due to the low volume of the speaker. These difficulties result in miscommunications between the two rooms, which reduce the ability of technicians to document the steps of the procedure and timely initiate imaging of the patient.

## Need 4
_Doctors need a stable way to store tools near the procedure table to improve equipment access and prevent containers placed on top of the patient from tipping._

During procedures, doctors place their tools on the patient. However, the patientâ€™s body is not a flat surface, and occasionally, the patient moves during the procedure. This results in tools moving around mid-procedure and spillage of any liquids like saline that are placed on top of the patient. When this happens, doctors spend time searching for the next tool they need, and their efficiency decreases. In addition, the scrub technicians have to spend time cleaning up the patient and refilling the saline that spills. This could decrease procedure times and improve patient experience, especially in non-invasive procedures.

## Need 5
_Medical providers need a unified method to capture high-resolution images of both pediatric and adult patients, while minimizing patient radiation exposure._

Pediatric patients generally require smaller radiation doses, which are safer on their thinner, developing tissues. There is one pediatric C-arm machine that delivers a lower dose of radiation suitable for pediatric patients. Sometimes, this pediatric C-arm machine is used to image adult patients. In these cases, the resulting images are less clear, due to the reduced amount of radiation used and the increased degradation of radiation through tissue. Having a singular device capable of imaging all patients would satisfy the versatile demands of a modern interventional cardiology suite.
